# Numerical_Method_Final_Project
```
Implementing under Matlab
Goal: Simulate basketball player shooting, and find out the perfect angle and spin under fix random error.
Consider force: Contain gravity force, drag force, magnus force, contact force,and friction force.
Run simulation.m to execute the program.
Set initial angle and spin.
-> The program will automatically adjust the force to let the basketball to the center of the rim without adding error.
